# Advent of Code 2019

### Day 1
- Calculate fuel based on mass formula
### Day 2
- Write IntCode computer: simple CPU running on integer array program
### Day 3
- Analyze intersections of line segments as wires
### Day 4
- Validate string passwords for certain conditions
### Day 5
- Extend IntCode computer: parameter modes (immediate or position), comparators, and jumps
### Day 6
- Calculate sum of path lengths to all nodes in a tree
- Find shortest path between nodes in a tree
### Day 7
- Modify IntCode computer
   - input and output from function (not stdin/out)
      - **TODO:** change to use generators
   - pause on output and return instruction pointer
- Chain together IntCode computers
   - **TODO:** maybe use threads with generators
### Day 8
- Decode image based on overlapping layers of pixel values (black, white, transparent)
### Day 9
- IntCode computer: add extra blank memory and relative parameter mode
### Day 10
- Count asteroids in lines of sight on 2D grid
- Simulate sweeps of laser clockwise around grid to destroy all asteroids
### Day 11
- Modify IntCode computer: run with continuous input/output until program halts
   - use generator function
- Track output of IntCode (painting robot controls) to identify painting
### Day 12
- Track 4 moons in orbit around each other
- Calculate energy based on positions and velocities
- Compute period of system by identifying periods of independent axes
### Day 13
- IntCode computer: Run Breakout game code
    - Difficult to determine when input is needed vs. when output
    - **TODO:** change IntCode computer to use queues, not generators where send causes next
- Count blocks in starting state
- Track score after all blocks destroyed by playing
    - Could use AI for paddle control, OR hack the input to make the paddle full width
